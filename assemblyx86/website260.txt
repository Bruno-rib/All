DVC COMPUTER SCIENCE CERTIFICATES

Five new, state-approved "certificates of achievement" in computer science are now available at DVC. One of the certifcates is for Computer Architecture which you can get if you complete the series: COMSC 110, 265(165), and 260. You can apply for the Computer Architecture certificate even though you are currently enrolled in comsc-260. If you fulfill the requirements for a certificate it will be noted on your transcript. You will find downloadable forms that you can fill out to apply for a certificate at the following link: DVC Computer Science Department

Windows 10 Screen Shot
Sometimes when you are having problems with a programming assignment and you need help, it is helpful to send the instructor a screenshot of the problem.

To take a screen shot of an area in Windows 10 hold down the shift and windows key together with 's'. Then draw a rectangle around the area you wish to capture which puts it into the clipboard. You can then paste it into an email and resize to a smaller size by dragging the corners of the image

Include the Irvine Library in your Visual Studio Project

In order to use the Irvine library functions you must include the Irvine Library in your Visual Studio Project. The Irvine Library is already installed on on the lab computers.

To include the Irvine library in your Visual Studio Project do the following:

Create your Visual Studio Project as usual. Then in the Visual Studio solution right click on your project name and select "Add existing item". Browse to where Irvine32.lib is located and select it. Irvine32.lib should then appear in your project.

You can find Irvine32.lib on the lab computers at C:\Irvine\Irvine32.lib.

You can also download Irvine32.lib by clicking on the following link: Irvine32.lib

Visual C++

If you wish to do your programming assignments at home I suggest you install VS 2017 Community which you can download at the following link: VS 2017 Community download

Important: when you install Visual Studio 2017 Community you must select “.NET Desktop Development” and “Desktop Development with C++” under the Workloads tab.

You can take advantage of syntax highlighting by installing AsmHighlighter as noted below.

Click on the following link for instructions on installing VS or watch the YouTube video in the YouTube video section below: visualCInstructions2602017.pdf

If you get the following error message while compiling: "fatal error LNK1281: Unable to generate SAFESEH image" . . .

If you get an "fatal error LNK1281: Unable to generate SAFESEH image" message while compiling your program in Visual Studio please do the following so that your program will compile.

project->properties->linker->advanced->Image has safe exception handlers->no (change yes to no)

If you get the following error message while compiling: "error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _mainCRTStartup" . . .

If you get "error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _mainCRTStartup" in the solution explorer right click on your project name then click on "Build Dependencies"->"Build Customizations" and make sure MASM is selected. Then right click on your source file then properties and make sure item type is "Microsoft Macro Assembler" and "Excluded From Build" is no or blank"

Error: A subsystem can't be inferred and must be defined

If you get the "a subsystem can't be inferred and must be defined" error while compiling you must select a subsystem by doing the following:
right click on your project and click on properties then click on the following: 
Project ->properties->Configuration Properties->Linker->System->SubSystem->Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)

Windows Defender detects a virus threat when you compile

After you compile your program a Windows Defender Virus threat may pop up. This means that Windows Defender has erroneously flagged your executable as a threat.

To avoid this error you must either disable Windows Defender or add an exclusion for your build directory which is usually your project directory.

To add an exclusion for your build directory do the following: Launch Windows Defender->Virus and threat protection->Virus and threat protection settings->exclusions->add an exclusion->folder name to exclude.

The default build directory (project directory) is: users->User name->documents->Visual Studio17 or 15->projects

Installing Visual Studio on a Mac

Before you can install Visual Studio on a Mac you must first install Windows. You have 2 choices for installing Windows: you can either have a dual boot system (Boot Camp) or you can run Windows as a virtual machine (Virtual Box or Parallels Desktop). In general if you run Windows on a dual boot system you will have better performance.

If you do an internet search for installing Windows on a Mac you will find lots of resources. Click on the following link for one such resource:
How to run Windows 10 on a Mac

Install AsmHighlighter or Asm-Dude for syntax highlighting

Currently the Visual C++ editor does not highlight the syntax for assembly language programs. You can add syntax highlighting by installing either AsmHighlighter or Asm-Dude per the directions listed below.

Install AsmHighlighter

You can add syntax highlighting the Community Edition of Visual Studio 2017 by clicking on the link below and downloading and installing AsmHighlighter.
To install AsmHighlighter exit all versions of Visual Studio then download and double click on the following file: AsmHighlighter2017.vsix

In order to get AsmHighlighter to work you may have to delete the following registry key: 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\(11.0, 12.0 or 14.0)\FontAndColors\Cache

You can manually delete the registry key by doing the following: you can launch the registry editor by searching for regedit in the "Search programs and files" box after clicking on the start icon.

To find out more information about AsmHighlighter you can click on the following link: AsmHighlighter

Asm-Dude

You can also add syntax highlighting to the Visual Studio 2017 by installing Asm-Dude.

To install Asm-Dude exit all versions of Visual Studio then download and double click on the following file: AsmDude.vsix

To find out more information about Asm-Dude you can click on the following link: Asm-Dude

Logging in to Lab Computers

Every time you come into the lab you must login with your DVC login.

Google Drive and Microsoft Onedrive

To access Google Drive you must have a Google account. If you have gmail you have a google account.

To access Google Drive please do the following:
-launch Google Drive from "All Programs"
-In the lower right of the taskbar click on the '^' then select Google Drive to login. After you have logged in then you should see Google Drive as a folder in Windows explorer. To launch Windows Explorer tap the Windows Key (circled flags on the bottom of the keyboard) and the 'e' simultaneously.

For instructions on how to access Microsoft OneDrive please click on the following link:
